Immerse myself in English. 
<!--more-->

When I try to study a new technology about the computer or the guide of development tools, some developers always recommend me to read the official guide. Although my reading speed is slow. But I do that. 

But, at the same time, I do a stupid thing that I translate the guide while I'm reading it. 

You know I'm just a beginner in English. It's difficult to do the thing. Because I need to understand what the official guideline is express and if my transaction has a mistake. And if I don't do it well, I will mislead the reader even the reader is me. 

Second, translate the English guidelines to my mother language is a difficult task. You can't guarantee the Chinese word you translated is 100 percent appropriate for the English word. So, in order to reduce the misleading situation, you need to compare the other translator. So that will take you a lot of time. That's what we don't want to happen. Because your aim is to study technology, you are not a translator. So you shouldn't spend a lot of time to pick an appropriate name for content the guidelines. 

Third, time is so precious. I hope my time should be spent at a thing that is important to me. I hope you will be the same. If you don't agree with, I won't prevent you. :) just do something you want. 

Finally, I will try to write my opinion in English. So, goodbye, translator.
