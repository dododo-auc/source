**21: Conspiracy Theories** (conspiracy [名] 阴谋;)

[00:02:05] Before we go into some of the **weirdest**([形] 怪异的; "weird" 的最高级;) ones out there, let's just define exactly what they are, why people believe them, and why they can be so **seductive**([形] 诱人的; 有魅力的;).
[00:02:31] You probably know about the **existence**([名] 存在; 生存;) of conspiracy theories such as that the moon landing was **faked**(fake [名] 赝品; 假货; 冒充者; [动] 伪造; 假装; 冒充; [形] 假的; 冒充的; 伪造的;), that JFK was **assassinated**(assassinate [动] 暗杀; 行刺;) by the CIA, or that 9/11 was **an inside job**(内部工作; 内部人员所为;).
[00:02:58] 29% of Americans, apparently, according to a recent survey, believe that there is a **deep state**(深层国家/政府) working against President Trump. 
[00:05:46] And while conspiracy theories used to be pretty **niche**([名] 合适的位置; 称心的职务; 商机; 生态位;) and would exist in **forums**(forum [名] 论坛; 讨论会;) and chat rooms deep in the **recesses**([名] 隐蔽处; 橱柜; [动] 休会; 把...放进橱柜;) of the internet, for a series of reasons they are now much more mainstream. 
[00:06:17] Others **attribute**([动] 由...引起; 把...归因于; 认为是...创作的; [名] 属性; 品质; 特征; 定语; ) this to a lack of trust in government and the authorities. 
[00:06:23] As people trust these kinds of institutions less and less, the more seductive it becomes to believe that there is some kind of great conspiracy that the government is **engaged**(engage [动] 参与; 从事; 吸引; 雇佣; 与...建立密切关系;) in against us, against normal people.
[00:06:40] While others blame politicians for **fanning the flames**(煽风点火;). 
[00:06:45] When the President of the USA is a serial conspiracy theorist, this **legitimates**(legitimate [形] 合法化的; 合理的; 法律认可的; [动] 使合法; 认为正当;) a lot of beliefs which would previously not have been **given the light of day**(得到阳光的照耀). 
[00:06:58] And while some conspiracy theories used to be sort of **laughable**([形] 可笑的; 逗人笑的;), the past few years have shown just how dangerous some of them can be.
[00:07:42] The restaurant owners, the owners of the pizza restaurant, were **harassed**(harass [动] 骚扰; 烦扰; 屡次侵扰;) by hundreds of people, and a 28 year old man turned up at the restaurant to 'self-investigate' with an **assault**([名] 攻击; 侵袭; 侵犯他人身体(罪); [动] 袭击; 突袭;) **rifle**([名] 步枪; 来福枪; [动] 快速搜寻;) and he fired three shots.
[00:07:59] The conspiracy theory has been completely **debunked**(debunk[动] 揭穿真相; 暴露;), proved to be completely false, and luckily nobody died, but **evidently**([副] 显然地;) it was pretty close. 
[00:08:12] So these kinds of conspiracy theories can be really dangerous, and obviously I wouldn't like to even give any **airtime**([名] 播放时间; 通话时间;) to any semi mainstream conspiracy theory.
[00:08:25] So today we are going to talk about three of the **wackiest**(wacky[形] 古怪的; 反常的; 滑稽可笑的; 疯疯癫癫的;), weirdest conspiracy theories out there. 
[00:08:34] All of these aren't a joke, there are people who really **genuinely**([副] 由衷地; 真诚地; 真正地;) believe them. 
[00:08:40] So without further **ado**([名] 无谓的忙乱; 小题大做; 麻烦;), our first one, our first conspiracy theory is that dinosaurs built the **pyramids**([名] 金字塔; 棱锥体;).
[00:08:50] Yes. Dinosaurs, the species that most people acknowledge to have been made **extinct**([形] 灭绝的; 熄灭的; 绝种的;) about 65 million years ago. 
[00:08:59] They are believed by some to have been **tamed**([动] 驯服; 使驯服; "tame" 的过去式和过去分词;), **domesticated**([形] 喜欢家庭生活的; 被驯养了的; [动] 驯养; 使爱家; 适应家庭生活;) by the **ancient**([形] 古代的; 古老的; [名] 古人;) **Egyptians**([名] 埃及人; 埃及语; [形] 埃及的; 埃及人的;) and to have built the pyramids. 
[00:09:11] The reason for this is **supposedly**([副] 据说; 据推测;) that some texts were found that show images of dinosaur-type creatures building the pyramids, but the evidence seems to be pretty **tenuous**([形] 脆弱的; 稀薄的; 空洞的;).
[00:09:41] Secondly, and this is one that I quite like, there is a conspiracy theory that Disney made the film Frozen in order to distract attention from the other conspiracy theory that Walt Disney, the creator of Disney, was **cryogenically**([副] 低温地;) frozen. 
[00:10:33] So some people believe that the reason the entire Frozen **franchise**([名] 特许经营权; 获特许经营权的商店; [动] 授予...特许经销权;) was created, and that it was called Frozen, was to fill up the search results with references to the actual film and not the conspiracy theory. 
[00:11:29] If you aren't familiar with **Stonehenge**([名] 巨石阵;), it's the **prehistoric**([形] 史前的; 陈旧的;) monument in the English countryside with huge stones **piled**([名] 桩; 堆; 摞; [动] 堆放; 叠放;) up on each other. It's estimated that it was constructed between 3000 and 2000 BC and **archeologists**([名] 考古学;) have no hard evidence actually for how these huge stones were lifted up on top of each other. 
[00:12:35] We could of course go on all day with weird conspiracy theories, and if you Google conspiracy theories, it really is a internet rabbit **warren**([名] 兔子窝; 狭窄拥挤的街区;), you could just go on and on all day, but I think this is quite enough for today's podcast. 
[00:12:53] I will leave that up to you if you want to continue the hunt for conspiracy theories, but as I've warned you, it is a **slippery**([形] 滑的; 狡猾的;) **slope**([名] 斜坡; 坡度; [动] 倾斜; 有坡度;). So we will leave it there for today. 

**23: Part 1: The Most Common Mistakes People Make When Learning English (and How to Avoid Them)**

[00:00:35] So it's a slight **deviation**([名] 偏离; 出轨; 背弃) from our usual topics of weird and wonderful things that happen in the world.
[00:01:16] We aren't going to be talking about **specific**([形] 具体的; 明确的; 特定的; [名] 特效药) mistakes people make, but rather **strategic**([形] 战略上的) mistakes **in terms of**([短语] 就...而言; 在...方面; 根据) the approach that you take when learning English.
[00:01:45] And if we talk about mistakes that you know that you don't make, well, you can give yourself a little **pat on the back**([短语] 鼓励;). 
[00:01:58] I'm certainly not, and don't feel **disheartened**([动] 使沮丧气馁; 使灰心;) if you notice some of your own behaviour in some of the things that we'll talk about today.
[00:02:26] As I was making my notes for this podcast, it became obvious that if I tried to **squeeze**([动] 捏; 榨; 挤 (进); [名] 捏; 榨; 挤;) everything into one podcast, well it would end up being quite long. 
[00:04:10] Materials are often **artificial**([形] 人造的; 人工的; 假的;), **staged**([名] 阶段; 时期; 舞台; [动] 举行; 上演;) situations and they're not really interesting at all.
[00:04:36] The result of this is that you can find yourself getting bored, you can't **motivate**([动] 引起动机; 激发; 激励;) yourself and you can't concentrate as well, and the study of language becomes a **chore**([名] 家务活; 杂事; 令人讨厌的或繁重的工作;), something boring to do, not a pleasure. 
[00:05:04] Just read or listen to content that hasn't been **dulled**([形] 愚笨的; 枯燥的; 感觉迟钝的; 无趣的; 阴暗的;) down specifically for language learners. 
[00:05:12]Not just listening to staged conversations or boring small-talk where you aren't actually learning anything **over and above**([短语] 过于; 除...之外; 另外;) language. 
[00:06:14] Everyone learns at a different **pace**([名] 一步; 步伐; 步速; [动] 踱步; 调整步伐;) using different techniques and different things work for different people. 
[00:06:51] It's completely natural to want to **engage**([动] 参与; 从事; 吸引; 雇佣; 与...建立密切关系;) with other learners and understand how your progress compares to theirs. 
[00:07:06] **By all means**([短语] 尽一切办法; 务必; 一定;), try out different **tactics**([名] 战术; 策略;), but you will find out what works for you and you shouldn't be comparing yourself **constantly**([副] 不断地; 时常地;) to the progress of others.
[00:08:27] This is something that actually **pains**([名] 痛苦; 苦恼;) me to see, and it's something that I see all the time with language learners.
[00:08:35] In the era of people thinking that there must be a hack, a shortcut for everything, a quick solution that means that you don't need to put in the hours, this is becoming increasingly **prominent**([形] 突出的; 显著的; 杰出的;).
[00:09:33] Thinking about it like this is just **framing**([名] 框架; [动] 制定; 把...框起来; 陷害; "frame" 的现在分词;) it in completely the wrong way . 
[00:09:38] Instead, you should **embrace**([动] 拥抱; 包围; 囊括; 接受; 信奉; [名] 拥抱;) the actual language learning process.
[00:09:47] Or to feel more **at ease**([短语] 安逸; 舒适; 自由自在;) in an English speaking country.
[00:10:08] Thinking of needing a hack makes language learning sound boring and **tedious**([形] 冗(rong3)长的; 沉闷的;), but it should be the opposite. 
[00:10:17] **Relish**([动] 喜欢; 享受; 从...获得乐趣; [名] 享受; 乐趣; 调味品;) it and suddenly looking for **elusive**([形] 难以捉摸的; 不易被抓获 (察觉, 理解或记忆) 的;) hacks.
[00:10:32] Our next mistake, which is something that almost everyone suffers from to a certain **degree**([名] 度; 程度; 学位;), is the fear of making mistakes. 
[00:10:42] Now I'm sure that you've heard this before, and being told, "don't be afraid", is about **as useful as being hit in the face with a wet fish**. So I will not **patronise**([动] 惠顾; 资助; 屈尊俯就;) you by saying that.
[00:13:00] I've got a good story here, which I think will be interesting and **relevant**([形] 相关的; 有意义的;) for a lot of you.

**24 Part 2: The Most Common Mistakes People Make When Learning English (and How To Avoid Them)**
[00:00:49] So if you haven't listened to part one yet and that sounds **right up your street**(對（某人）的胃口，在（某人）的興趣範圍內), then go and give that a listen.
[00:01:23] Okay, mistake number six is a very common mistake that millions, tens, even hundreds of millions of English learners make, and that is to focus on grammar as a **standalone discipline**(独立的学科). 
[00:01:38] Grammar in English has its easy parts, but like anything, it has its **tricky bits**(a bit tricky 有点棘手, 有点困难) too, and once you've covered the basics, the foundation of English grammar, the more complicated the grammar gets, the harder and more **never-ending**(永无止境, 没完没了) it can seem. 
[00:03:01] You'll remember from part one that our first mistake was to not focus on interesting content, and you would have to be a bit of a **masochist**([名] 受虐狂), slightly strange person if you were to classify grammar books as interesting content.
00:03:19] Yes, of course, it's useful to have a base understanding of English grammar, how various words are **conjugated**([形] 共轭的), and so on.
[00:04:52] If you can embrace the **quirkiness**([名] ), the weirdness, the strangeness of English grammar, and stop worrying about learning it as a standalone discipline, then you'll be amazed at how quickly you actually learn grammar.
